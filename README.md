# TinyHead

This code is a subset of [the RadioHead library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/)
Please send the money, beer, fame and credits to them.

Based on RadioHead version 1.74_124

## Intro
The ATtiny85 is a great chip but it has limited memory. RadioHead is a great libray but it is large and only supported by some 'cores' and not by my favorite ATtiny core by [Dr. Azzy](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore).

This is why I took only what I need from the RadioHead library and made it into a library for the Arduino IDE.

## How
- Use [this](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore) core
- Only works with ASK
- Use the examples

I made this to make use of these:
